TODO: check for frame info, GPURasterizer::Draw??
CHECK CACHE USE??
Memory has to do with frame performance?
Interleaved jank?? Pipelining, finding overlap??
Check if elapsed >>>> build + raster + vsyncoverhead, weird events??
Does start time have anything to do with it?
Overlap, VSYNC GUIDE????
is startTime in microseconds from app start??
Animator.Render, args.frame_number --> check in timeline events.
Raster / GPURasterizer::Draw delays: these are the extra microseconds? (They are in microseconds order)
Animator::BeginFrame, Animator::Render
Higher jank delay, worse jump??
Count watching graphic tops??
Test with non-complete, check vsyncoverhead
when jank is too high, is it vsyncoverhead? --> check if smooth_flutter solves it
